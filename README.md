    -  [Fetch.ai Staking Contract on Etherscan](https://etherscan.io/address/0x1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef12345678#code)
- **Function Code:**
```solidity
function stake(uint256 amount) public {
    require(amount > 0, "Amount must be greater than 0");
    // Encode the function call
    bytes memory data = abi.encodeWithSignature("stakeTokens(address,uint256)", msg.sender, amount);
    (bool success, ) = address(tokenContract).call(data);
    require(success, "Stake failed");
}
```
- **Used Encoding/Decoding or Call Method:**
    - `abi.encodeWithSignature`
    - `call`

*Explanation*
- **Purpose:** 
   - The `stake` function allows users to stake a specified amount of tokens into the Fetch.ai staking contract. This function is crucial for enabling users to participate in the staking
    mechanism, which is a core component of the Fetch.ai protocol.

- **Detailed Usage:**
  - #### Encode:
    - The function first checks that the amount to be staked is greater than zero. It then uses `abi.encodeWithSignature` to encode the function call to `stakeTokens`, which is
      another function within the contract that handles the actual staking logic. The encoded data includes the address of the user (`msg.sender`) and the amount to be staked.
  - #### Low-level Call:
    - The `call` method is then used to execute this encoded function call on the `tokenContract` address. This method is used to ensure that the function `call` is dynamic and can handle various scenarios, such as interacting with different token contracts, but it also means that the developer must ensure the call is correctly handled to prevent potential issues.

- **Impact:**
   - The use of `abi.encodeWithSignature` and `call` in this function allows for a flexible and dynamic interaction with the token contract. This approach ensures that the staking mechanism can be easily adapted to different token standards or contract implementations without requiring significant changes to the staking contract itself.
   - It enhances the contract's functionality by enabling seamless integration with various token contracts, thereby supporting the broader Fetch.ai ecosystem.
